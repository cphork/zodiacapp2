## Project Description

In this project I will create a Zodiac App with compatibility.

## API

apiKey:  API key was not needed for this website.

url: https://aztro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

```
{data: {"current_date": "June 23, 2017", 
"compatibility": " Cancer", 
"lucky_time": " 7am",
 "lucky_number": " 64", 
 "color": " Spring Green", 
 "date_range": "Mar 21 - Apr 20",
 "mood": " Relaxed", 
 "description": "It's finally time for you to think about just
  one thing: what makes you happy. Fortunately, that happens to be a person who feels
  the same way. Give yourself the evening off. Refuse to be put in charge of anything."}}
```


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

- [add link to your wireframes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dejg3dz16/image/upload/v1619763472/Project_2_Wireframe_ltmaku.jpg)
- [add link to your react architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/dejg3dz16/image/upload/c_scale,w_2706/a_270/v1620403669/react_architecture_copy_hgdtb0.jpg)


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
-Find a zodiac/horoscope api that's free and usable
-Render components to ensure app is running
-Test out api to confirm all data returns correctly
-Ensure all routes are routed and imported correctly
-Render codes in correct components to ensure all paths are located correctly
-Style App to appear intuitive


#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

-Detailed styling to make App user friendly
-Add links to 'crystal' shops and inspirational quotes

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Love Compatibility | This will be a random selection by clicking a button |
| Individual Signs | This will render individual form to pull up individual signs info. /daily horoscopes |
| Compatibility info. | This will display the random signs chosen once button is clicked |
| Signs info. | This will display individual signs and their characteristics/daily horoscopes |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Add components in Visual Code | H |  1 hr | :1 hr | :---: |
| Import all components  | H |  1 hr  | 1 hr | :---: |
| Add functions to all components | H |  1 hr | 1 hr | :---: |
|  Make Api call for two different endpoints | H |  4 hrs | 6 hrs | :---: |
| Test each endpoints to retrieve needed data | H | 2 hrs | 2 hrs | :---: |
| Adding forms with interactibility| H |  6 hrs | 8 hrs | :---: |
| Adding form for signs | H |  2 hrs | 2 hrs| :---: |
| Adding button for compatibility with interactability | H |  4 hrs | 4 hrs | :---: |
| Test forms | H |  1 hr | 1 hr| :---: |
| Test Header | H |  3 hrs | 2 hrs | :---: |
| Test header links | H |  2 hrs | 1 hr| :---: |
| Confirm all data pulled correctly | H |  6 hrs | 8 hrs | :---: |
| Style pages | H |  4hrs | 4 hrs | :---: |
| Style buttons | H |  2 hrs | 1 hr| :---: |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |

| Total | H | 39 hrs | 42 hrs | --- |

## Additional Libraries
 -Bootstrap (did not use for this project)

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

<!-- const handleOnClick = () => {
        setRandomImage(shuffleTarot[Math.floor(Math.random() * (shuffleTarot.length))])
        
    }

return (

    <>
    <h1 className='tarot-header' >Today's Tarot</h1>

<div className='random-tarot-btn'>
<button className='tarot-btn' onClick={() => handleOnClick()}>CLICK ME</button>
</div> -->

```
function reverse(string) {
    // here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
